# Hello_World

Hi! 
I am a U2G student from the University of Iowa. 
My major is Enterprise Leadership and I am currently doing a Master's degree in Business Analytics at same time.
I am looking for an internship next summer to gain more experience in business analytic that can give me the opportunity to practice on technical skills such as Python, SQL, JMP, Tableau, and Microsoft Office.
